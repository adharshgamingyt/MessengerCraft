## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[MessengerCraft Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/tree/main/docs).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum
-->

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/tree/main/docs). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for MessengerCraft, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/tree/main/docs) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and the built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most MessengerCraft users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

Before diving into your first code contribution, please ensure you have the right development environment set up to work effectively with MessengerCraft:

#### Development Environment Setup

- **IDE Selection**: Choose an IDE that offers strong support for TypeScript and React development:

  - **Visual Studio Code** is recommended with our [suggested extensions](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/blob/main/docs/vs%20code%20setup/index.md) for optimal development experience
  - **WebStorm** is also an excellent choice with built-in TypeScript and React support
  - Any other IDE with TypeScript and JSX/TSX syntax highlighting and linting capabilities

- **Runtime Environment**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) is required for running and testing the project
  - Install Bun following the instructions on their official website
  - Verify your installation with `bun --version` in your terminal

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Install dependencies** with `bun install`
4. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix using descriptive naming, e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode` or `fix/message-display-bug`
5. **Make your changes** following our [Styleguides](#styleguides)
6. **Test your changes** locally with `bun test`
7. **Commit your changes** with a [clear commit message](#commit-messages)
8. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

#### First-time Contributor Tips

- Start with issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
- Ask questions in the comments if anything is unclear
- Communicate early and often with maintainers about your approach
- Be receptive to feedback and prepared to make requested changes

We're excited to see your contribution and are here to help you throughout the process!

### Improving The Documentation

Documentation is crucial for the success of MessengerCraft. We welcome improvements to make our documentation more comprehensive, accurate, and user-friendly.

#### Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized in the [`docs`](https://github.com/adharshgamingyt/MessengerCraft/tree/main/docs) directory and includes:

- Installation guides
- API documentation for contributor's
- Usage examples
- Tutorials
- Developer guides

#### Documentation Contribution Guidelines

1. **Identify areas for improvement** - Look for outdated information, gaps in coverage, or unclear explanations
2. **Create a separate fork** for documentation changes to maintain clear distinction between code and documentation updates
3. **Follow the existing documentation style** to maintain consistency
4. **Include code examples** where appropriate
5. **Check for grammar and spelling** before submitting your changes
6. **Update table of contents and navigation** if you add new sections
7. **Preview your changes** before submitting them

#### Documentation Format

- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Include screenshots or diagrams where they help explain concepts
- Break down complex topics into smaller, digestible sections
- Use heading levels appropriately for document structure

If you notice inaccuracies or have suggestions for improving existing documentation, please open an issue describing the problem before submitting changes.

## Styleguides

Following consistent coding and documentation standards helps make the codebase maintainable and accessible to all contributors. Please adhere to these guidelines when contributing to MessengerCraft.

### Code Formatting

- **Use Prettier** for automatic code formatting
  - Our repository includes a `.prettierrc` configuration file
  - Configure your IDE to format on save if possible
  - Run `bun format` before committing to ensure all files are properly formatted
  - This ensures consistent code style across the entire codebase

### Code Quality

- **Remove unused code** - Don't leave commented-out code blocks or unused variables/imports
- **Refactor duplicated logic** into reusable functions or components
- **Write self-documenting code** with clear variable and function names
- **Add comments** only when necessary to explain "why" not "what"
- **Follow React best practices** when writing component code

### TypeScript Standards

- Use strong typing and avoid `any` type when possible
- Define interfaces for component props and state
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types when appropriate
- Keep type definitions close to where they're used

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Maintain or improve test coverage with your changes
- Follow the existing testing patterns in the codebase

While some aspects of these guidelines are automatically enforced, taking the extra effort to maintain high code quality is a valuable skill and greatly appreciated by the entire community.

### Commit Messages

A well-structured commit history helps maintain a clean and readable project history. Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages.

#### Commit Message Format

We follow the **Conventional Commits** format:

```md
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body> (optional)
```

- `type`: Describes the nature of the change. Examples:

  - `feat`: A new feature

  - `fix`: A bug fix

  - `docs`: Documentation updates

  - `style`: Code formatting, whitespace, missing semicolons, etc. (non-functional changes)

  - `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality

  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests

  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, build updates, dependency bumps, etc.

- `scope`: A short descriptor for what the change affects (e.g., `messages`, `ui`, `auth`). If irrelevant, this can be omitted.
- `subject`: A concise description of the change in imperative form (e.g., “Add support for dark mode”).
- `body` (optional): If needed, include a more detailed explanation of what was changed and why.

### Examples

✅ Good commit messages:

```md
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
fix(ui): resolve layout shift in message list
docs: update installation guide for Bun
test(messages): add unit tests for message encryption
```

❌ Avoid:

```md
fixed bug
updated stuff
more changes
```

### Additional Guidelines

- Keep commit messages concise yet informative.

- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

- If a commit closes an issue, mention it in the message using GitHub keywords (e.g., fixes #42).

- Squash trivial commits where possible to keep the history clean.
